{"name":"P3top4","tagline":"Bachelor Degree Thesis","body":"### Welcome to my first repository and project page.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ java -jar p3top4.jar\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nThe code works very well but is not structured at all. The data is hard-coded in the GUI and the logic is not entirely written in Prolog. Possible future updates would include the data to be retrieved from the Prolog database and the logic to be implemented only in Prolog. The GUI will be written in Java and will be dynamic. That means that the GUI will be build at runtime depending on the Prolog's database.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis project was written for my Thesis to demonstrate the use of the JPL Library, a bidirectional Prolog/Java interface, which is part of SWI-Prolog. You can find the documentation in which the project is based at http://www.swi-prolog.org/packages/jpl/.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you have any kind of questions regarding the project do not hesitate to contact me at t.selalmasidis@gmail.com.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
